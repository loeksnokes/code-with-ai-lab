# Handout: Reviewing AI-Generated Code for IP Issues

Use this quick checklist when you accept or adapt AI-generated code.

- Review and Understand
  - Read the code thoroughly before using it.
  - Ensure it fits your requirements and coding standards.
- Search for Matches
  - For substantial blocks (functions/classes), search the web and GitHub for matching code.
  - If you find a match, check the original license.
- Licensing Rules
  - Permissive (MIT, Apache 2.0) — usually OK, follow attribution if required.
  - Copyleft (GPL, AGPL) — may impose license obligations on your project.
- Document AI Use
  - Add a comment indicating AI assistance, e.g., `// Generated with assistance from GitHub Copilot`
  - Record substantial AI contributions in the repo README.
- Avoid Sensitive Data
  - Do not paste proprietary data or secrets into public AI tools.
- Consult Policy / Legal
  - Follow your institution’s IP policy and consult legal/IP advisors as needed.
- Use Version Control
  - Commit with descriptive messages and keep a clear history of AI-sourced changes.
