# Session 1 — Warmup & Icebreaker Activity

Total time: 15 minutes (hands-on warmup) + 5–10 minutes group sharing

Purpose: ensure all participants can open the lab repo, run tests, and try an AI suggestion. Also encourage discussion about expectations and concerns.

Activity steps (individual, 15 minutes)
1. Open `/exercises/01-intro-python` in VS Code.
2. Run tests: `pytest -q`. Confirm they fail or pass initially.
3. Use an AI tool to implement `greet(name: str) -> str` in `starter.py`.
4. Run tests again and ensure they pass. If they fail, inspect errors and fix.

Pair/share (optional, 10 minutes)
- In pairs or small groups, discuss:
  - Did the AI suggestion need changes? Which parts were correct / incorrect?
  - Any licensing / sourcing worries from suggestions?
  - Did you encounter environment/setup issues?

Reporting back (5 minutes)
- Each group share one quick observation or question for the instructor.

Facilitator tips
- If someone has no Copilot, ask them to use ChatGPT or write the solution manually — it’s about process not tool ownership.
- Keep the activity timebox short: instructors should circulate and help solve environment issues quickly.
