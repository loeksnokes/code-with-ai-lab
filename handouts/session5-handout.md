# Session 5 — Wrap-up, Demos & Next Steps (Student Handout)

Duration: 60 minutes  
Purpose: demo checklist, reflection prompts, and a short adoption checklist for continuing to use AI tools responsibly.

---

## Demo checklist (3–5 minutes per demo)
For each demo, prepare a 1-slide summary and a 3–5 minute talk covering:
1. Problem statement (30s) — what you set out to solve.  
2. Approach (30–60s) — how you used AI and manual edits.  
3. Demo / screenshot (60–90s) — show results or tests passing.  
4. AI assistance summary (30–60s) — which tool, what it produced, what you changed.  
5. Key takeaway (30s) — one lesson learned.

Include a one-paragraph “AI assistance summary” in your slide or PR:
- Tool/model: [Copilot / ChatGPT / other]  
- What the AI produced: [short]  
- Human changes made: [short]

---

## Reflection prompts (for discussion)
- Where did AI help most (productivity, ideas, tests)? Where did it mislead you?  
- What checks (tests, code review steps) became routine after using AI suggestions?  
- How would you document AI use in a public repository versus an internal one?

---

## Longer-term adoption checklist (for after the course)
- Add unit tests and CI to all projects.  
- Install and use `pre-commit` hooks (black, ruff/flake8, isort).  
- Document AI-assisted changes in PRs and change logs.  
- Add a lightweight license-scan step in CI for contributed code (e.g., search for long matches).  
- Keep PRs small and review-focused.

## Submission & follow-up
- If your demo code lives in a branch, ensure it is tidy (squash local WIP commits if requested by instructors).  
- Provide: branch name, PR link (or paste PR body into Teams), and a 1–2 sentence note: “AI assistance summary”.
