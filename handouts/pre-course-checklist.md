Pre-Course Checklist:
Coding and Programming Using AI for Efficient Coding

The following pre-course steps will support participants in getting the most from the course. The steps are not difficult, but they may take an hour or two (particularly if you watch any videos). Setting up some forms of Copilot access requires processing from GitHub and may take a few business days. We recommend starting by Thursday, 2025-10-23 if possible.

We will support 30 slots for the course. To help manage places fairly, please complete Step 3 of the checklist by 9 AM Monday, October 27th, 2025. This will help ensure a smooth start and allow you to take part in all hands-on activities.

If you need support to meet the deadline, contact us as soon as possible — KE Hub at KEhub@newton.ac.uk, Collin Bleak at cb211@st-andrews.ac.uk, or George Tyler at grlt20@bath.ac.uk. If we do not hear from you and the required setup is not completed, we may offer your place to someone on the waiting list.

Note: GitHub had indicated they might follow up about Copilot tokens (providing free unlimited access to Copilot for the duration of the course), but we have not received confirmation. Because that email has not arrived, please proceed with the setup and alternatives as described below.

1. Install Required Software
☐ Download and install Visual Studio Code (VS Code)  
  - VS Code download: https://code.visualstudio.com/  
  - This will be our main code editor for the course.  
☐ (Optional) Download GitHub Desktop  
  - GitHub Desktop: https://desktop.github.com/  
  - Helpful if you prefer a graphical interface for managing repositories.

2. Set Up Your GitHub Account
☐ Create a GitHub account (if you don’t already have one)  
  - Sign up for GitHub: https://github.com/join  
  - Verify your email address.  
☐ Sign in to your GitHub account before the course.  
  - You will use this account to join the course repository and participate in collaborative activities.

3. Set Up GitHub Copilot (AI Coding Assistant)
Note: We are not able to guarantee Copilot tokens for participants. Please try the options below.
☐ For Academic/Educator Participants:  
  - Apply for Copilot via GitHub Education (if eligible): https://education.github.com/  
  - Copilot docs / getting started: https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/getting-started-with-github-copilot  
  - If you are a verified student or educator, you may be eligible for Copilot free access. Start this early — verification can take a few days.
☐ For Business, Industry, Government (BIG) Representatives:  
  - Arrange Copilot access through your organisation or purchase individually: https://github.com/features/copilot  
  - Alternatively, try the limited Copilot free access / trial (availability may vary).
☐ Install the Copilot extension in VS Code (if you have access)  
  - GitHub Copilot extension (VS Code Marketplace): https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot  
  - Sign in using your GitHub account and confirm Copilot is active.
☐ If you do not have paid Copilot access, you can still take part in the course. Copilot Chat or other limited-access modes are available, and we will provide alternative tools and instructor demos so you can follow the hands-on work.

4. Pre-Course Familiarization (Optional but Recommended)
☐ Watch a short guide: "Getting started with GitHub" (Quickstart):  
  - GitHub Hello World quickstart: https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/hello-world
☐ Read the Copilot quickstart guide:  
  - Copilot quickstart: https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/getting-started-with-github-copilot

5. Technical Preparation
☐ Ensure you have a stable internet connection.  
☐ Be ready to use Microsoft Teams for course delivery (we expect screen sharing).  
  - Microsoft Teams download/help: https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-teams  
☐ Save your GitHub and VS Code login information for easy access during the session.

6. Questions or Issues?
If you need help with setup, contact the course organiser/instructor before the course:
- KE Hub: KEhub@newton.ac.uk  
- Collin Bleak: cb211@st-andrews.ac.uk  
- George Tyler: grlt20@bath.ac.uk

Completing this checklist before the course will help you get the most from the sessions and participate fully in all activities. If circumstances prevent you from meeting the deadline, please contact the organisers as soon as possible so we can try to accommodate you.
