# Root Solver - Task Summary

Overview
- Exercise to use GitHub Copilot to implement a solver for differentiable expressions.

Task
- There is currently already a newton solver in there that is incomplete. Use copilot to complete it.
- Then, check the test works and use copilot to generate more tests.
- Optional: Get Copilot to generate a different root solver and generate tests for this new method.
