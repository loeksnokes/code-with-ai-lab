Exercise 05 — Test-Driven Development: Implement `is_prime`

Goal
- Implement the function `is_prime(n: int) -> bool` using TDD practices.
- Tests are provided; write minimal code to satisfy tests iteratively.

Instructions
1. Run `pytest -q` to see failing tests.
2. Implement `is_prime` in `primes.py`, run tests, iterate until all pass.
